üõ°Ô∏è IR Playbook ‚Äì 1.2: Brute Force Attack Detection
--


üìñ Overview
-
This project demonstrates how to detect, investigate, and respond to Brute Force attacks on Windows authentication logs using Splunk SPL queries. The playbook is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to ensure standardized adversary behavior tracking.

The detection focuses on identifying excessive failed logon attempts (EventID=4625), analyzing patterns of attack (e.g., password spraying vs. credential stuffing), and correlating with successful logins (EventID=4624) to spot potential compromises.

By combining baseline detection, enrichment, threat hunting patterns, and threat intelligence lookups, this playbook provides a complete detection-to-response workflow for brute force attacks.

üîë Key Benefits:

Detect brute force attempts in real-time.

Differentiate attack strategies (spraying vs. stuffing).

Enrich with IP geolocation & threat intelligence feeds.

Provide structured IR investigation & response steps.

Automate alerts for SOC teams.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Detection ‚Äì Find Excessive Failed Logons

sql

index="sim1" sourcetype="csv" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" EventID=4625
| stats count by Source_IP, Account_Name
| where count >= 5
| sort - count

üëâ This baseline query identifies source IPs with 5 or more failed authentication attempts against any account. Adjust the count >= 5 threshold based on your environment's normal noise level.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Enrichment ‚Äì Add Context to the Attacks


Now we expand: When did this happen? What was the target?


sql

index="sim1" sourcetype="csv" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" EventID=4625
| stats count earliest(_time) as First_Attempt latest(_time) as Last_Attempt by Source_IP, Account_Name
| eval Duration = Last_Attempt - First_Attempt
| where count >= 5
| sort - count


üîç This gives:
‚Ä¢	Source_IP: The attacking host.
‚Ä¢	Account_Name: The target user account.
‚Ä¢	count: Total number of attempts.
‚Ä¢	First_Attempt, Last_Attempt, Duration: The timeframe of the attack campaign.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Threat Hunting ‚Äì Identify Attack Patterns
Categorize the attacks to understand the adversary's strategy.

sql

index="sim1" sourcetype="csv" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" EventID=4625
| stats count dc(Account_Name) as Targeted_Users by Source_IP
| where count >= 5
| eval Attack_Type=case(Targeted_Users==1, "Password Spraying", Targeted_Users>1, "Credential Stuffing/Brute Force")
| sort - count


üëâ Key Insight:
‚Ä¢	Password Spraying (Targeted_Users==1): Many attempts against a single account. Indicates the attacker may know a username.
‚Ä¢	Credential Stuffing/Brute Force (Targeted_Users>1): Fewer attempts against many accounts. Indicates the attacker is trying common passwords across the domain.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Threat Intel ‚Äì External Reputation Check
Enrich the attacking IPs with threat intelligence.

spl

index="sim1" sourcetype="mitre_logs" EventID=4625
| stats count by Source_IP, Account_Name
| where count >= 5
| iplocation Source_IP
| table Source_IP, City, Country, count, Account_Name

üëâ Now you‚Äôll see the geolocation of the source IP  with City, Country, count, Account_Name

-------------------------------------------------------------
5Ô∏è‚É£ IR Investigation Steps
When a brute force attack is detected:
1.	Confirm the Target(s): Identify the user account(s) being targeted. Are they high-value (e.g., Administrator, domain admins, service accounts)?


2.	Check for Success: Immediately search for a successful login (EventID=4624) from the same Source_IP immediately following the failure spike.

sql
index="sim1" (EventID=4624 OR EventID=4625) Source_IP="192.168.212.28"
| transaction Source_IP, Account_Name startswith=(EventID=4625) endswith=(EventID=4624)
| table _time, Source_IP, Account_Name, EventID


3.	Review Account Activity: If a success is found, investigate what that account did immediately after logging in (other events from that user session).
4.	Check IP Reputation: Manually look up the IP in AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------
6Ô∏è‚É£ Response Actions

‚Ä¢	If Malicious & Ongoing:
1.	Block the IP at the network perimeter (firewall) or host level (Windows Firewall via GPO).
2.	Force password reset for any potentially compromised accounts.
3.	Alert the targeted users to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity.
4.	If a successful login occurred, initiate your incident response protocol for compromised accounts.

‚Ä¢	If Benign:
o	Could be a misconfigured service or script. Document the exception and tune the alert to exclude that source IP if appropriate

-------------------------------------------------

7Ô∏è‚É£ Alerting ‚Äì Make it Continuous

Create a scheduled Splunk alert:
‚Ä¢	Search: The base detection query.
‚Ä¢	Schedule: Run every 10 minutes.
‚Ä¢	Trigger Condition: where count >= 5
‚Ä¢	Action: Send an alert to your SIEM/SOC channel with details: Source_IP, Account_Name, count, and a link to investigate.
